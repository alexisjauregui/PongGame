# PongGame

Made sourcing tutorial for SFML on youtube channel by Gerald McAlister with CLION IDE. Includes 3 versions of play
Single Player with AI, Two Player with one player using UP and DOWN key and the other using W and S respectivly.
Third mode is a special Blockade mode which just contains some blocks that made the game a bit more harder. No
sprites were using only shapes from SFML library. Sound is from WavSource.com and the font is Googles DroidSans.ttf.
To pause game at any point press SPACE.
